# Imaginator-AI-Image-Generator
Imaginator
Imaginator is a Full-Stack MERN-based AI Image generator web application that enables users to generate a wide range of AI-based images, art, and memes. It is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the MERN stack.

The Open AI DALL-E Model has been integrated into Imaginator to enable users to generate high-quality AI-based images, art, and memes with ease. With the ability to search for any kind of SCIFI image, users can download the AI-generated image and share it with the community.

The frontend of the application has been built using ReactJS and the backend using NodeJS and ExpressJS, providing a seamless user experience. To optimize performance and scalability, Cloudinary, a cloud-based image storage service, has been implemented to store and manage images.
